Visual Studio Uninstaller
=========

This executable is designed to cleanup/scorch all Preview/RC/RTM releases of Visual Studio 2013, Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio vNext.  It should be used as the last resort to clean up the user's system before resorting to reimaging the machine. 

Running this application will break Visual Studio 2012 and earlier versions of Visual Studio because Visual Studio 2012 have some MSIs that have the same upgrade codes as Visual Studio 2013 and above.

How it works?
========

This app finds and uninstall every Preview/RC/RTM releases of Visual Studio 2013/2015/vNext.  It will first execute uninstall command on the bundle, and then it will uninstall any stale MSIs.  The application contains a master list of Bundle IDs and upgrade codes for every MSI ever chained in by Visual Studio 2013-vNext.  It will not uninstall MSU or MSIs that marked as ReallyPermanent.

Goals/Vision/Scope
========
Our goal is to provide a way to thoroughly and reliably remove Visual Studio.  This program first attempts to force uninstall Visual Studio from top down, and then remove any remaining MSIs and MSUs.  This program will work on any BURN based Visual Studio; that means this program is only capable of removing Visual Studio 2012 and above.

**How to debug Total Uninstaller remotely?**

IMPORTANT: Do not run this on your development machine without setting the `DoNotExecuteProcess` flag.  This will prevent the application from uninstalling the very development environment you are working from.   

To get the most out of the debug experience, I recommend the following:

  1. Create a VM with Dev14 installed.
  2. Start the 64-bit remote debugger with administrative privileges.
  3. Copy the debug Bin directory to the VM.
  4. Run the application with Administrative privileges.
  5. Create a snapshot of the machine using Hyper-V.
  6. Start a remote debugging session to your VM and attach.
  7. Step through to your hearts delight.
  8. If you find something you don’t like, restore the snapshot and recopy the Bin directory and go to step 6 again.

**Using Total Uninstall:**

  1. Download and unzip the zip file to a folder.
  2. Open cmd.exe with Administrative privileges
  2. Execute Setup.ForcedUninstall.exe
  3. Press Y and hit enter to run the application.
  4. If the application ask to reboot the system, please reboot the system, and rerun this application again.

**Commands:**

  1. help or /help or /? : Print usage.
  2. break : run the application and pause until the user hit any key.
  3. noprocess : run the application but does not uninstall anything.

Roadmap
========
1. Periodically update of the Total Uninstaller to ensure the data used for uninstallation is up to date with the most recent Visual Studio releases.

Open issues
========
There's currently no known major issue with the latest release.
